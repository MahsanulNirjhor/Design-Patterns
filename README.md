## Introduction

Design patterns provide general reusable solutions to common problems faced during software development. They encapsulate best practices to design software in a way that makes it more modular, flexible, and easy to understand.

In this repository, we explore various design patterns and their implementations in Java. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding design patterns is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Getting Started

To get started with learning and implementing design patterns in Java, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-java.git
    cd design-patterns-java
    ```

2. Explore the different folders for each design pattern, containing the Java source code and examples.

3. Read the code, understand the problem each pattern solves, and see how it is implemented.

4. Experiment with the examples, make modifications, and see how the patterns affect the behavior of the software.

## Contributing
